# AirBnB_clone
The first step towards building an AirBnB clone is to create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This step is crucial because it sets the foundation for all other projects. The task involves creating a parent class, implementing serialization/deserialization, creating classes for AirBnB objects, building a file storage engine, and creating unittests to validate the classes and storage engine.
